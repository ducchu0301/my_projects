Set layout to 'Default'
When create a new C# file, should defines the name right away after created file. If not the file will create Class with 'NewBehaviourScript' and we have to change the Class name too when renaming C# file name

Ex:

Renaming a file from default to HelloWorld after created file is not automatic update Class name
